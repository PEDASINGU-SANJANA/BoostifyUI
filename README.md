# BoostifyUI - Bootstrap 5 Responsive Web Pages

## Project Overview
BoostifyUI is a simple and modern responsive web UI project built using Bootstrap 5. The project consists of three main pages: Home, About, and Contact. The primary goal was to explore Bootstrap components, understand their structure, and create a clean, polished, and mobile-friendly design by remixing Bootstrap examples.

## Features
- Responsive navbar with page navigation
- Hero section with call-to-action on the Home page
- Features section showcasing key aspects with Bootstrap cards
- About page highlighting mission and services
- Contact page with a functional contact form
- Consistent styling and spacing using Bootstrap 5 utility classes
- Fully responsive design suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (via Bootstrap 5 CDN)
- Bootstrap 5 components and utility classes
- GitHub repository for source code hosting
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Setup and Usage
1. The HTML files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`) were created in VS code and was uploaded to a GitHub repository.
2. The site was deployed using GitHub Pages connected to the repository.
3. To view the website, navigate to the GitHub Pages site URL linked from the repository settings.
4. Navigation between pages is possible via the navbar on each page.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Learning to combine Bootstrap components:** Instead of copying examples, components were remixed to build original pages.
- **Ensuring responsiveness:** Pages were tested on various devices using browser dev tools; utility classes were adjusted accordingly.
- **Form design:** Created a clean contact form using Bootstrap components with validation where applicable.

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of Bootstrap 5's grid system and utility classes.
- Hands-on experience remixing UI components to design cohesive pages.
- Practical knowledge in responsive web design and cross-device testing.
- Experience with GitHub for code hosting and GitHub Pages for deployment without local git usage.

## Time taken
- Approximately 1 hour.

## External Resources and Help
- Bootstrap 5 official documentation and examples
- Perplexity for coding guidance and best practices
- Online tutorials on responsive design and GitHub Pages deployment
